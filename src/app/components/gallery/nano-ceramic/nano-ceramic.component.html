        <h2>Graphene Hybrid</h2>
        <p>
          Graphene Hybrid is a state-of-the-art ceramic coating designed for
          ease of use and visibility with the help of our UV Flashlight and
          patent-pending UV Tracer Technology. This advanced formula delivers
          long-lasting, extreme self-cleaning properties and is suitable for a
          variety of surfaces including single-stage and clear-coated paints,
          glass, plastic trim, polycarbonate, rubber molding, and wheelsâ€”all
          with just one bottle.

        <h2>Hybrid+</h2>
        <p>
          is our premier hybrid coating solution. It establishes a permanent
          bond with the surface, creating a robust protective layer that shields
          your paintwork from harmful contaminants. Diamond Hybrid Plus can be
          applied in multiple layers, resulting in a thicker, harder coating
          that offers extended durability and superior protection.
